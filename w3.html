            <h4>Fusion 360</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Given that I had experience in Fusion 360 I managed to get my 3d Model ready quite easily.
            <ol>First I found an image of a guitar that was easy to sketch and created a sketch of it in photoshop. Photoshop wasnt the smartest idea for a sketch but it was the only one that was available to me for the time being. The sketch was then inserted into Fusion 360. </ol>
             <img src="assignments/w3images/sketch%201.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" width="600" height="750">
            <br>
            <br>

            <ol> I then imported the sketch of the guitar body I wanted to create.</ol>
            <img src="assignments/w3images/f360sketch.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" width="600" height="750">
            <br>
            <br>

            <ol> Then using the Extrude tool I pulled the body and neck up. </ol>
            <img src="assignments/w3images/360extrude.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" width="600" height="750">
            <img src="assignments/w3images/neckextrude.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" width="600" height="750">
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol> I made the holes for where the electronics should go. The electronics for this are still being sorted out and should be ready soon!
            Till then I made the holes and heres the final outcome:</ol>
            <img src="assignments/w3images/cut.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" width="600" height="750">
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol> I further added the 3d model to different parts of the website using the features offered by Fusion itself. This can be found <a href="More.html#model" class="w3-button">
                here </a> and :</ol>

			<h4>Photoshop</h4>

            <br>
            <p> Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor. Apart from the intial sketch, I also used Photoshop to make the poster. To do this, I first imported the guitar in the software and then proceeded to add text and other elements till I was happy about it.</p>
            <img src="assignments/w3images/rg.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image " alt="Table Setting" width="600" height="750">
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol> The reason I used Photoshop is I wanted to use it to create a better visual representation of my Final Project. </ol>

            <h4>tinkerCad</h4>
            <br>
            <p> TinkerCad is possibly the least powerful of all the softwares I have used. </p>
            <img src="assignments/w3images/light.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-min" alt="Table Setting" width="600" height="750">
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol> I used TinkerCad to make a smiple working circuit and played with electronic equipment to learn and design more. </ol>



            <h4>Blender</h4>
            <br>
            <p> Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games. It is by far one of the hardest softwares to learn and really complicated if started ouut without any tutorial. I used blender guru's tutorial to learn how to make a table. </p>
