                Designing and printing the screen stand:
            </p>
            <ol>Started out by getting all the measurements of the screen and deciding where the screen would go after consultation with the electronics team.</ol>
            <ol>Got the dimensions and then figured out the design I wanted to go with. </ol>
            <ol>I started out by making the hole for where the electronics would fit </ol>
            <ol>Then added a border around it so the screen would sit flush inside</ol>
            <ol>Added a panel to the side of it so that we could stick it on the inside.</ol>
            <ol>Added holes for the screw. </ol>
          
                <br><br>
            <p>
                Apart from all this I helped with the dying, glueing, driling of holes, waterproofing and scewing the wheels on. </p>
