      <p class="w3-large">When it was time to choose my final project idea, I still had 3 options left on the table. I decided to pick up the one thing that had shaped my life for the better. The guitar. A huge part of my life revolves around this stringed instrument and what better way to challenge myself than by making a guitar thats not exactly a guitar?
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">This idea came to me when a friend of mine told me that every time she saw me she expected me to pull the guitar out and start jamming. Thus my head wandered and got fixated on the idea that I wanted to build a guitar that i can move around with all the time.</p>
